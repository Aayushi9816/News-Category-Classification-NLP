The four reasons cited the most are the dread of returning from a vacation to piles of work (40 percent), the belief that no one will be able to step in and do their job for them while they're gone (35 percent), not being able to afford it (33 percent) and the fear of being seen as replaceable (22 percent). ""Americans suffer from a work martyr complex,"" said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. ""In part, it's because 'busyness' is something we wear as a badge of honor."" Clearly, we need to work harder about working smarter -- by not working all the time.
